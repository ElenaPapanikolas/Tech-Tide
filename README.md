## Installation
There is no installation needed. Navigate to the deployed link below to use the application.

## Usage
To use the application simply navigate to the deployed link on [Render](https://tech-tide.onrender.com/). The user will be presented with the Tech Tide homepage with a navbar at the top that shows all links to the different pages. The homepage shows all posts on the blog. You must be logged in to use the application, so if you click on the "Add a Comment" button you will be told you need to log in. If you click on a post, while not logged in, you will be taken to the login page with a login form, to log in if you already have credentials. If you don't have credentials you can click the "Sign Up" button and the Sign Up form will render. Once successfully logged in, you will be taken to your Dashboard. The dashboard shows all posts made by the user that is currently logged in. From the dashboard the logged in user can create new posts by clicking the "+ New Post" button and a modal will pop up with a New Post form. Once the form is complete and the "Create Post" button is clicked, the newly created post will be rendered to the dashboard. To edit or delete a post simply click the respective buttons on the post you wish to edit or delete. The homepage will show all posts created by every user and if you click on a post you will be taken to that specific post page and all comments associated with that post will be shown. To add a comment to a post click the "Add a Comment" button and a modal will pop up with a Comment form. Once the form is complete and the "Add a Comment" button is clicked you will be taken to the page of the post that you commented on and will see your comment along with any others. If you click the logout button you will be logged out and taken back to the homepage.
